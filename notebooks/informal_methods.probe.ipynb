       "  'completion': '\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest possible sum of the digits of a number N, where N is a positive integer less than 2018, divisible by 8, and has at least two distinct digits. Alright, let me break this down step by step. \\n\\nFirst, let\\'s recall that a number divisible by 8 must have its last three digits divisible by 8. But since N is less than 2018, the maximum N can be is 2016 (since 2018 is not divisible by 8; 2018 divided by 2 is 1009, so 2016 is 252*8). So N is a number between 1 and 2017, divisible by 8, with at least two different digits, and we need the minimal digit sum. \\n\\nHmm, the minimal digit sum. The smallest possible digit sum would be 1, but that would require a number like 8, 80, 800, etc., but those only have one distinct digit (if we consider 8 as a single digit, but 80 has two digits but 8 and 0, which are distinct). Wait, actually 8 is a single-digit number, so it only has one digit, so that\\'s invalid. 80 has two digits, 8 and 0, so that\\'s two distinct digits. But wait, 80 is divisible by 8? 80 divided by 8 is 10, so yes. So 80 would have a digit sum of 8 + 0 = 8. But maybe there\\'s a smaller digit sum?\\n\\nWait, let me think again. The digit sum can\\'t be less than 1, but since the number must have at least two distinct digits, the minimal digit sum would be 1 + 0 = 1, but can such a number exist? Let\\'s see: numbers like 10, 100, 1000, but those are not divisible by 8. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25, so not divisible. 100 divided by 8 is 12.5, still not an integer. 1000 divided by 8 is 125, which is okay, but 1000 has digits 1, 0, 0, 0. Wait, but the digits must be at least two distinct. 1000 has two distinct digits: 1 and 0. So 1000 is divisible by 8, is less than 2018, and has digit sum 1. But wait, 1000 is less than 2018? Yes, 1000 is less than 2018. But hold on, is 1000 allowed? Let me check the problem statement again.\\n\\nWait the problem says \"positive integer less than 2018 such that N is divisible by 8 and has at least two distinct digits.\" 1000 is divisible by 8 (since 1000 /8 = 125), has two distinct digits (1 and 0), and its digit sum is 1. But that would be the minimal possible digit sum. But is 1000 considered here? Let me check if there is a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm. 1000 is indeed divisible by 8, yes. 8 x 125 is 1000. The digits are 1 and 0, so two distinct digits. The digit sum is 1+0+0+0 = 1. But that seems too good to be true. Maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again. \\n\\nWait the problem says \"has at least two distinct digits.\" So 1000 has two distinct digits, so that\\'s okay. The digit sum is 1, so that would be the minimum. But maybe the problem requires N to be a two-digit number? Wait no, it just says a positive integer less than 2018. So 1000 is allowed. Hmm. But maybe I overlooked some constraint?\\n\\nWait, the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" so numbers like 888 would not qualify because all digits are the same, but 1000 is okay. But 1000 is a four-digit number, but since it\\'s less than 2018, it\\'s allowed. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the divisibility by 8 again. The rule is that the last three digits must be divisible by 8. For 1000, the last three digits are 000, which is divisible by 8. So yes, that\\'s okay. \\n\\nHmm, so is 1000 the correct answer here? Then the minimal digit sum would be 1. But the problem says \"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N.\" If that\\'s the case, then why is the problem here? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the problem again.\\n\\nWait the problem says \"N is a positive integer less than 2018 such that N is divisible by 8 and has at least two distinct digits.\" So 1000 is a candidate. However, maybe the problem is expecting numbers with more digits? Or perhaps I missed a condition? Let me check again.\\n\\nWait, maybe the problem requires N to have at least two different digits, but in 1000, there are two digits: 1 and 0, so that\\'s okay. So 1 is the minimal digit sum. But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the number to have at least two distinct digits, but in some other way? Like, the digits can\\'t all be the same except for one? Wait no, the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" so as long as there are two different digits, even if others are repeated. So 1000 is okay.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there is a smaller N with digit sum 1? Let\\'s see. The number 1000 is 1000. The next possible number with digit sum 1 would be 100, but 100 divided by 8 is 12.5, not an integer. 10 is 10, which divided by 8 is 1.25, not integer. 1 is a single digit, but it\\'s not divisible by 8. 0 is not positive. So 1000 is the only number with digit sum 1 that is divisible by 8 and has two distinct digits. So maybe 1 is the answer?\\n\\nWait, but the problem says \"positive integer less than 2018,\" so 1000 is allowed. Hmm. Maybe I need to check if the problem is from somewhere else where maybe leading zeros are not allowed? But numbers don\\'t have leading zeros. So 1000 is fine. Wait, but maybe the problem is from an Olympiad where sometimes they might have some other constraints, but the problem as stated here doesn\\'t mention that. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the divisibility. Let me confirm 1000 divided by 8 is indeed 125, which is an integer, so that\\'s okay. So if that\\'s the case, then 1 is the minimal digit sum, but perhaps the problem is expecting a higher digit sum. Let me check if 1000 is the only number with digit sum 1. Let\\'s see, 1000, 100, but 100 isn\\'t divisible by 8. 10 isn\\'t either. So 1000 is the only one. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the number to have at least two digits? Because 1000 has four digits, but even if it\\'s four digits, it\\'s okay. Wait, but if the problem requires at least two digits, then numbers like 8 (single digit) would be invalid, but since 1000 is four digits, it\\'s okay. Wait, the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" not \"at least two digits.\" So even if it\\'s a four-digit number, as long as two of the digits are different, it\\'s okay. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the problem is from an official competition where 1000 is considered, but perhaps there\\'s a trick here. Wait, the problem says \"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N.\" So if 1 is achievable, then that\\'s the answer. But maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me see again.\\n\\nWait, let me think of numbers less than 2018 divisible by 8 with two distinct digits. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nFirst, the digit sum of 1000 is 1. Is there a number with a digit sum less than 1? No, since digits are non-negative integers, the minimal digit sum is 1. So 1 must be the answer. \\n\\nWait, but maybe I\\'m missing something here. Let me see if the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" so numbers like 80 (digits 8 and 0) have a digit sum of 8. 1000 has a digit sum of 1, which is lower. So unless there\\'s a mistake in my reasoning, 1 is the minimal digit sum. But why would the problem be presented as a challenge then? Maybe I made a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, let me check if 1000 is allowed. The problem says N is less than 2018. 1000 is less than 2018. It is divisible by 8, yes. It has two distinct digits, 1 and 0. So that should be okay. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the number to have all digits non-zero? But the problem didn\\'t state that. Or maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again:\\n\\n\"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N where N is a positive integer less than 2018 such that N is divisible by 8 and has at least two distinct digits.\"\\n\\nNo, there\\'s no mention of non-zero digits. So 1000 is acceptable. Therefore, the minimal digit sum is 1. Hmm, but the problem might be expecting a different answer. Let me check for numbers with digit sum 1. The only numbers with digit sum 1 are numbers like 1000, 100, 10, 1, but only 1000 is divisible by 8 and has at least two distinct digits. \\n\\nWait a second. Let me check 1000 again. The digits are 1, 0, 0, 0. So two distinct digits: 1 and 0. So that\\'s okay. So the digit sum is indeed 1. \\n\\nHmm, but maybe I need to check the problem\\'s source. Since the user hasn\\'t specified, but given that it\\'s a problem from an Olympiad perhaps, maybe there\\'s a restriction that the number must have more digits? For instance, maybe two-digit numbers? But the problem doesn\\'t state that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires the minimal N? But no, it\\'s the minimal digit sum.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that 0 is considered a digit here. Wait, 0 is a digit, so in 1000, the digits are 1,0,0,0. So yes, 0 is a digit. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number has at least two different non-zero digits? But the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" so 0 and 1 are distinct digits. \\n\\nHmm, I think my reasoning is correct here, but since the problem is presented as needing a more involved solution, maybe I need to check again. Let me consider numbers with digit sum 1. 1000 is the only one. If that\\'s allowed, then 1 is the answer. \\n\\nWait, but let me check 1000. Let me confirm once more. \\n\\n1000 divided by 8 is 125, so yes. The digits are 1, 0, 0, 0. Two distinct digits: 1 and 0. So that\\'s okay. Digit sum is 1. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts leading zeros? But numbers don\\'t have leading zeros. 01000 is not a number, it\\'s 1000. \\n\\nHmm, so perhaps the answer is indeed 1? But maybe the problem wants the minimal digit sum greater than 1? But the problem didn\\'t say that. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering 1000. Let me see. The problem says N is a positive integer less than 2018. 1000 is less than 2018. So that\\'s okay. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires N to have more than one distinct digit but not just 0 and something else? Wait, but 0 is a digit. So 1 and 0 are two distinct digits. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in base 10, but the digits are considered as non-zero? But no, digits can be zero. \\n\\nHmm, maybe I need to check for numbers with digit sum 2? Let\\'s see if there are numbers with digit sum 2 that are divisible by 8 and have at least two distinct digits. For example, 1000 has digit sum 1, which is better, but if that\\'s allowed, then 1 is the answer. But maybe the problem is from a source where numbers cannot have leading zeros, but 1000 doesn\\'t have leading zeros. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check numbers like 1000, but let me see if there is a smaller number with a digit sum of 1. The next lower number would be 100, but that\\'s 100, which divided by 8 is 12.5, so not an integer. 10 is 10, which divided by 8 is 1.25, not integer. 1 is 1, not divisible by 8. So 1000 is indeed the smallest. \\n\\nHmm, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider numbers where all digits are non-zero? Let me check that. If that\\'s the case, then the digit sum can\\'t be 1 because you can\\'t have a digit sum of 1 with non-zero digits unless it\\'s a single-digit number, which can\\'t have two distinct digits. \\n\\nWait, if we have non-zero digits, the minimal digit sum with two distinct digits would be 1 + 2 = 3? For example, 12, but 12 isn\\'t divisible by 8. 20 is divisible by 8 (20 / 8 = 2.5, no). Wait 24 is divisible by 8 (24 /8=3). 24 has digits 2 and 4, so two distinct digits, digit sum 6. Hmm. Wait, but if non-zero digits are required, then 1000 is invalid because it has zeros, so then the minimal digit sum would be higher. But the problem didn\\'t specify that. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an Olympiad where numbers are considered as, say, three-digit numbers? But the problem says less than 2018, so four-digit numbers are allowed. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the divisibility rule. Let me confirm again. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For numbers with fewer than three digits, check the entire number. For example, 8 is divisible by 8, but it\\'s a single digit, so only one digit, which doesn\\'t satisfy the two distinct digits. \\n\\nWait, 8 is a single digit, so only one digit, so it can\\'t have two distinct digits. 16 is two digits: 1 and 6, which are distinct. 16\\'s digit sum is 7. 24 is 2+4=6. 32: 3+2=5. 40: 4+0=4. Wait, 40 has two digits, 4 and 0, so two distinct digits. Digit sum is 4. \\n\\nWait, 40 is a candidate with digit sum 4, which is better than 80 (digit sum 8). Wait, but 40 is smaller in digit sum. Hmm. Let me check 40. 40 is divisible by 8 (40/8=5). The digits are 4 and 0, so two distinct digits. The digit sum is 4. \\n\\nBut 1000 has a digit sum of 1, which is way lower. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe 1000 is not considered because it has four 0s? But the problem doesn\\'t say anything about that. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the problem\\'s upper limit again. It says less than 2018, so 2016 is allowed. 2016 is divisible by 8 (2016/8=252). Its digits are 2, 0, 1, 6. The digit sum is 2+0+1+6=9. Not better than 1. \\n\\nWait, maybe there\\'s a number between 1000 and 2016 with a lower digit sum? Let\\'s see. Let\\'s think of numbers like 1000, 1008, 1016, etc. \\n\\n1008: digits 1,0,0,8. Two distinct digits (1,0,8) so three distinct digits. The digit sum is 1+0+0+8=9. \\n\\n1016: digits 1,0,1,6. Two distinct digits (1,0,6). Digit sum 1+0+1+6=8. \\n\\nHmm. 1000 is still better. \\n\\nWait, how about 1120? 1+1+2+0=4. But 1120 divided by 8 is 140. So 1120 is divisible by 8, but its digit sum is 4. Still higher than 1. \\n\\nAlternatively, 1000 is the best. \\n\\nAlternatively, let\\'s check numbers below 1000. Let\\'s see if there are numbers with digit sum less than 1? No. \\n\\nNumbers with digit sum 1 would have to be 1000, 100, 10, or 1. But only 1000 is divisible by 8. \\n\\nSo unless there is a number with digits like 0001, but that\\'s just 1, which is single-digit. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe numbers like 008, but that\\'s 8, which is single-digit. \\n\\nThus, 1000 is the only number with digit sum 1. \\n\\nHmm, so maybe the answer is 1. But the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" which 1000 satisfies. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the problem requires the number to have all digits distinct? No, it says \"at least two,\" so having more is okay. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in thinking 1000 is allowed. Let me check the exact wording again: \"positive integer less than 2018 such that N is divisible by 8 and has at least two distinct digits.\" \\n\\nYes, so 1000 is allowed. \\n\\nTherefore, I think the minimal digit sum is 1, so the answer is 1. But since the problem is presented as needing more thought, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let me check another angle. \\n\\nWait, maybe the problem requires that the number has at least two different non-zero digits? But that\\'s not stated. If that were the case, then 1000 wouldn\\'t count because it only has a 1 and 0. Then, the minimal digit sum would be higher. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there\\'s a restriction I\\'m not considering. Let me think of other numbers with digit sum 1. There are none except 10...0. So 1000 is the only four-digit one. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the minimal N, not the minimal digit sum? But the question clearly states \"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N.\" So it\\'s about the digit sum. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the divisibility by 8. Let me confirm 1000 again. 1000 divided by 8 is 125. 125 times 8 is 1000. Correct. \\n\\nHmm, so maybe the answer is indeed 1, but since the problem is presented here, maybe there\\'s a trick. Wait, perhaps the problem requires N to be a three-digit number? But the problem says less than 2018, so four-digit numbers are allowed. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"at least two distinct digits\" is misinterpreted. Let me check the exact wording again. \"has at least two distinct digits.\" So two or more. So 1000 has two (1 and 0). \\n\\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps leading zeros are not counted? But numbers don\\'t have leading zeros. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a non-English source and \"digits\" refers to non-zero digits? But that\\'s speculative. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the problem\\'s constraints once more. Let me re-express the problem in my own words: find the smallest digit sum among numbers less than 2018, divisible by 8, and with at least two different digits. \\n\\nGiven that, 1000 has digit sum 1, so that\\'s the minimal possible. Therefore, maybe the answer is 1. \\n\\nWait, but let me see the possible digit sums. Let me check numbers with digit sum 1. 1000 is the only one. \\n\\nDigit sum 2: possible numbers would be like 2000, but that\\'s over 2018. 200 is 200. 200 divided by 8 is 25. So 200 is 2,0,0. Two distinct digits. Digit sum 2. \\n\\nWait a second! 200 is less than 2018, divisible by 8 (200/8=25), and has digits 2 and 0. So two distinct digits. Its digit sum is 2. \\n\\nOh! Wait, I didn\\'t think of that. 200. So 200 has a digit sum of 2. Which is better than 1000\\'s digit sum of 1? Wait no, 2 is higher. Wait, but 200 is a three-digit number with digits 2,0,0. So two distinct digits. So digit sum 2. \\n\\nWait, but 1000 has digit sum 1, which is smaller. So why didn\\'t I think of 200 before? Because I thought 1000 was the only one with digit sum 1, but 200 has digit sum 2. \\n\\nWait, but maybe there are numbers with digit sum 1. Let me think again. \\n\\nNumbers with digit sum 1 must have a 1 followed by zeros. So 1000, 100, 10, 1. But 10 is two digits, 1 and 0. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25, so not divisible. 100 divided by 8 is 12.5, so not divisible. 1 is a single digit. So only 1000 is divisible by 8. \\n\\nSo 1000 is the only one with digit sum 1. \\n\\nWait, so why did I think of 200? Because it has a digit sum of 2, which is higher. \\n\\nSo 1 is the minimal possible digit sum. \\n\\nWait, but let me check 1000 again. The problem says \"positive integer less than 2018,\" so 1000 is okay. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires the number to have more digits? Like, two-digit numbers? But the problem allows any positive integer less than 2018, so four-digit numbers are okay. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my initial thought. Let me check the problem again. \\n\\nWait, the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" so 1000 is okay. So the minimal digit sum is 1. \\n\\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering 1000 as having digit sum 1. Wait, 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 is 1. Yes. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there is a number with digit sum 1 that I haven\\'t considered. For example, 1000, 100, 10, or 1. But only 1000 works. \\n\\nWait, so unless there is a number like 10000, but that\\'s over 2018. \\n\\nHmm. Therefore, I think the answer should be 1. But since the problem is presented here as needing a more complex solution, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \\n\\nWait, perhaps the problem requires the number to be a three-digit number? The problem says less than 2018, so numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit (up to 2017). \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there\\'s a rule I\\'m missing here. Let me think of other numbers with low digit sums. \\n\\nLet me check 1008. Digit sum is 1+0+0+8=9. \\n\\nWhat about 112? 112 divided by 8 is 14. So 112 is divisible by 8, digits 1,1,2. So two distinct digits. Digit sum is 1+1+2=4. \\n\\nHmm, 200 has digit sum 2. \\n\\nWait, 200 is a valid number, right? 200 divided by 8 is 25, so yes. Its digits are 2,0,0. Two distinct digits. \\n\\nSo digit sum of 2. But 1000 has digit sum 1, so that\\'s better. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the problem requires the digits to be non-zero? The problem didn\\'t state that. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts 0 as a digit but requires at least two non-zero digits? But the problem says \"at least two distinct digits,\" so 0 and another digit is okay. \\n\\nWait, maybe the problem is from a competition where numbers can\\'t have leading zeros, but 200 is fine. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires the digits to be in increasing order or something else? The problem didn\\'t say that. \\n\\nHmm, given that, I think 1000 is acceptable and gives digit sum 1, so the minimal possible. \\n\\nWait, but let me check another angle. Maybe 1000 is excluded because it\\'s a four-digit number and the problem expects a three-digit number? The problem didn\\'t specify. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in considering 1000 as less than 2018. Wait, 1000 is less than 2018. Yes. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if 1000 is actually allowed. For example, if the problem is from a math competition where sometimes numbers are considered in a certain way, but unless specified, it should be allowed. \\n\\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to check if there are other numbers with digit sum 1. Let me think of numbers like 1000, but in other forms. \\n\\nWait, 1000 is the only four-digit number starting with 1 followed by three zeros. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe 1000 is the only number with digit sum 1. \\n\\nThus, I think the answer is 1. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the problem once more. It says \"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N.\" So if 1 is achievable, that\\'s the minimum. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the digit sum of 1000. Let\\'s add the digits: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1. Yes. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the number of distinct digits in the sum? No, the problem says \"sum of the digits,\" not the number of distinct digits. \\n\\nHmm. Given all that, I think the answer is 1, so \\\\boxed{1}. \\n\\nWait, but let me check some other numbers just to be thorough. Let\\'s see numbers with digit sum 1: only 1000. \\n\\nNumbers with digit sum 2: 200 (2), 1001 (1+0+0+1=2 but 1001 divided by 8 is 125.125, not integer), 1010 (1+0+1+0=2, but 1010/8=126.25, not integer), 1100 (1+1+0+0=2, 1100/8=137.5, not integer). \\n\\nSo 200 is the only one with digit sum 2. \\n\\nThen numbers with digit sum 3: 300 (3, but 300/8=37.5 no), 120 (1+2+0=3, 120/8=15, yes. So 120 is divisible by 8, digits 1,2,0. Two distinct digits? 1,2,0 are three distinct digits. So yes. Digit sum 3. \\n\\nSo 120 is a three-digit number with digit sum 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, 300 is not divisible by 8. 201 (2+0+1=3, but 201/8=25.125). \\n\\nSo 120 is valid with digit sum 3. \\n\\nBut since 200 has digit sum 2 and is valid, that\\'s better. \\n\\nBut 1000 is better with 1. \\n\\nHmm. So I think my conclusion is correct. \\n\\nWait, but the problem might have a typo or something. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem\\'s constraints. Let me check again: \\n\\n\"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N where N is a positive integer less than 2018 such that N is divisible by 8 and has at least two distinct digits.\" \\n\\nYes, so 1000 is acceptable. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the number to have exactly two distinct digits? But no, \"at least two\" is the wording. \\n\\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires the number to not start with a 1? But that\\'s not stated. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to confirm once again that 1000 is indeed less than 2018. Yes, 1000 is way less. \\n\\nHmm, so unless there is an error in the problem statement, I think the answer is 1. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an older year where the upper limit was different, but as per the user\\'s question, it\\'s 2018. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in base 10? Yes. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if 0 is considered a valid digit in the sum. Yes, it is. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the digits to be in non-decreasing order? No, that\\'s not stated. \\n\\nHmm, given all this, I think the answer is indeed 1, so I should put \\\\boxed{1}. \\n\\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe the problem requires N to have at least two distinct digits, but in the case of 1000, does it have two distinct digits? 1 and 0, so yes. So that\\'s okay. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that all digits except one are the same? But no, \"at least two distinct digits\" just requires that not all digits are the same. Since 1000 has three 0s and one 1, so it\\'s okay. \\n\\nHmm, I can\\'t find any reason to exclude 1000. Therefore, I think the answer is 1. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the problem once again. The user says \"Find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of N.\" \\n\\nSo if 1 is achievable, that\\'s the answer. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the divisibility. Let me check 1000 divided by 8. \\n\\n1000 divided by 8: 8 × 125 = 1000. Correct. \\n\\nTherefore, I think the answer is 1. \\n\\nWait, but in my initial consideration, I thought of 80 (digit sum 8), but 1000 is better. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires N to be even, but divisible by 8 already implies even. \\n\\nHmm. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there is a number with digit sum 1 that I haven\\'t considered. Let me see: numbers like 1000, 100, 10, 1. 100 is 100, which divided by 8 is 12.5, so not integer. 10 is 10, which divided by 8 is 1.25, not integer. 1 is single digit. So only 1000 works. \\n\\nThus, I think the answer is indeed 1. \\n\\nWait, but let me check with another number like 10000, but that\\'s over 2018. \\n\\nAlternatively, 1008: digit sum 9, which is higher. \\n\\nHmm. Alright, I think I\\'ve considered all possibilities. The minimal digit sum is 1. \\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{1}\\n </think> \\n\\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of a positive integer \\\\( N \\\\) less than 2018, divisible by 8, and having at least two distinct digits.\\n\\n1. **Divisibility by 8**: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. Since \\\\( N \\\\) is less than 2018, the maximum \\\\( N \\\\) can be is 2016.\\n2. **Digit Sum Consideration**: The smallest possible digit sum is 1, which can be achieved if a number has a 1 followed by zeros. \\n3. **Check Validity**: \\n   - The number 1000 is divisible by 8 (since \\\\( 1000 \\\\div 8 = 125 \\\\)).\\n   - The digits of 1000 are 1, 0, 0, 0, which include two distinct digits (1 and 0).\\n   - The digit sum of 1000 is \\\\( 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \\\\).\\n\\n4. **Verification**:\\n   - Other numbers with digit sum 1 (like 10, 100) are not divisible by 8.\\n   - Numbers like 200 (digit sum 2), 120 (digit sum 3), etc., have higher digit sums.\\n\\nThus, the number 1000 meets all the criteria and has the minimum digit sum of 1.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{1}\\n\\\\]',\n",
